<h1 class=title>The Story of Jimothy</h1>
<h3>Pray</h3>
<p>You pray. In the midst of all of this chaos, you find peace. The smoke surrounds you. The flames lick at your feet. You feel the sweat run down your forehead. But you still keep your inner cool. Then out of nowhere you feel a gust of wind and a loud popping noise. You then find yourself in a white room with a robed skeleton in front of you. His stance and physique remind you of someone. You donâ€™t remember who though. He then lets out a robed hand, beckoning you. You step closer and suddenly out of the ground two objects pop out. Upon closer inspection, one is a bow made out of bees that shoots bees. The other is a sock full of pebbles. The skeleton then draws his sword. WHAT DO YOU CHOSE?
