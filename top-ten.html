	<h4> My Top 10 Zelda games</h4>
	<p> Here is the list. It's really hard to choose the best games as all Zelda games are genuinely good. They have a combination of great plot, gameplay, and never seem to get old on us. However, I arranged this list on the games that I thought were the most rich in plot or gameplay. Maybe both. For each spot, I will describe the plot and a bit about the gameplay. Overall, I do not think there is such thing as a bad Zelda game. Disclaimer: I haven't played most of the games.</p>

	<p> Link's Awakening isn't particularly special gameplay wise. While you could switch from overhead to sidescrolling (which is similar to Zelda II), trade, fish, and play the ocarina (used in the next game Ocarina of Time), it still was a typical overhead RPG. What made it interesting was the premise It actually doesn't take place in Hyrule(the place where all of the Zelda games take place). Infact, what happens in the game is you're on a ship which is traveling to another land. A storm destroys your ship causing you to black out and wash up onshore of an island called "Koholint Island". When he wakes up, he meets some characters and reclaims his sword. A mysterious owl then tells him that he has to obtain 8 instruments from 8 dungeons in order to wake up the Wind Fish. This Wind Fish will take him back home. After he gets the instruments and awakens the Wind Fish, he has to fight one last evil spirit: all of the enemies of his past. After defeating this final boss, the owl swoop in to reveal that this was all his dream and that he needs to wake up. He then awakens the Wind Fish one last time. After doing this, he wakes up to find himself floating on a piece of driftwood in the middle of the ocean. The story of this game was honestly great. There also were many cameos to other Nintendo games such as Mario, Yoshi, Kirby, and many more. </p>

	<p> Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages had a cool feature where the two games were connected. Each game had an ending. However, to get the true ending, you'd have to complete each game. Each game had a similar, but different premise. In Oracle of Seasons, Link finds himself in a dark forest with a dancer named Din(who is the goddess of power). The antagonist of the server (who calls himself Onox) captures Din. Link then gets teleported to the great Maku Tree. He tells  Link that he has to complete 8 dungeons to obtain 8 essences of Nature. Link also obtains the Rod of Seasons which allows him to change the seasons. After giving the 8 essences, the Maku Tree gives Link the Huge Maku Seed which allows him to get into Onox's castle. He then defeats Onox and frees Din. Twinrova (two witches, they are an antagonist of many gmaes) states that the Flame of Destruction has been lit. Oracle of Ages is very similar to Oracle of Seasons. Only difference with Oracle of Ages is: Din is replaced by Nayru, Onox is replaced with a villain named Veran, and finally, the time flow has now been disrupted. Link can now enter a portal which transports him from the past and present. He does this with the Harp of Ages. Also, the essences of nature now have been replaced with the essences of ages. After he defeats Veran and frees Nayru, Twinrova states that the flame of sorrow has been lit. If you link the two games via password, you can achieve the true ending. In the true ending, Twinrova captures Zelda lighting the flame of despair. He then faces Twinrova who is trying to ressurect Ganon(the King of Evil). He defeats Twinrova and a deformed Ganon. He then rescues Zelda and escapes. The gameplay was very similar to Link's Awakening. The most interesting part was the Harp of Ages and Rod of Seasons. Each effected the time of the game. This allowed you to reach certains spots and many other things. The fact that the two games were linked was very interesting too. Overall, it was a cool game. </p>

		<li id="number8"> Link Between Worlds </li>
		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/The_Legend_of_Zelda_A_Link_Between_Worlds_NA_cover.jpg/220px-The_Legend_of_Zelda_A_Link_Between_Worlds_NA_cover.jpg" alt="Link Between Worlds" width="250px" height="250px">
	<p> Link Between Worlds gave Link a cool new ability: he could merge into a walls. This new mechanic causes him to become 2d and stick to the wall. While in this state, he can move left or right. This allows the player to reach certain areas that are normally unaccesable. The game takes place in Hyrule as usual. However, theres a twist. Theres an upside down version of Hyrule: Lorule. Everything in Lorule is an upside down counterpart to Hyrule. There's an opposite Link, opposite Zelda, and an opposite Triforce(the heavenly power of the three goddesses of Hyrule, it's split into three parts: Power, Wisdom, and Courage). The plot is: a mysterious figure (named Yuga) starts turning the seven sages of Hyrule into paintings. Meanwhile, Link (a blacksmiths son in this game) randomly meets someone named Ravio. Ravio asks if he can stay at Link's house in return for a mysterious braclet. He goes to Zelda who tells him to obtain the master sword. As he's strolling through the forest, Yuga pops out of nowhere and attempts to turn Link into a painting. However Link is protected from the bracelet and gains the power to turn into a painting at will. Link returns to the castle and sees Yuga turn Zelda into a painting. He chases Yuga through a portal and finds himself in Lorule. He sees Yuga using the 7 sages and Zelda to revive Ganon. He then absorbs the triforce of power (contained by Ganon). Just then, Princess Hilda (Zelda's counterpart) traps Yuga and tells Link to rescue the 7 sages who have been scattered about the land. She also says after he does this, he'll obtain the triforce of courage. Link does this and goes back to Lorule castle to find Hilda trying to obtain the triforce of wisdom from Zelda. She reveals all along that the Lorulean Triforce was destroyed long ago and that she plants on using the Hyrulean Triforce to restore Lorule to it's former glory. She untraps Yuga to make him take the triforce of courage from Link. However, Yuga betrays her and turns her into a painting, stealing the triforce of wisdom. With Zelda's help, they defeat Yuga and turn Hilda back to normal. Ravio pops in out of nowhere and reveals he is Link's counterpart. He then talks sense into Hilda saying stealing Hyrule's triforce is wrong. Zelda and Link say their farewells and return to Hyrule. They then use the triforce to restore Lorule's triforce and everything ends happily ever after. The main part of the gameplay was puzzles and dungeons which you could complete in any order. The game was similar to many other games. There was also side quests and minigames. However, an interesting new mechanic was you could rent items you haven't gotten yet with Ravio. Overall, the game was actually very good. </p>

		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Legend_of_Zelda_Skyward_Sword_boxart.png/220px-Legend_of_Zelda_Skyward_Sword_boxart.png" alt="Skyward Sword" width="250px" height="250px">
	<p> This game is considered one of the worst Zelda games by many people as it had weird Wii motion controls, was fairly linear, and a new mechanic: <strong> THE STAMINA WHEEL</strong>. The stamina wheel starts to deplete as you are doing actions (ex. carrying, running, and climbing). When it fully depletes, you get exhausted and have to recharge it. However, there isn't much to say about the game. It was a fairly solid game. It had some new mechanics (which were annoying to most), you could ride a bird, you could scan your area for objects, and it had decent characters. What was most interesting about th egame was the fact that it's first in the timeline. This game shows how Legend of Zelda all started. It takes place on a group of floating islands in the sky. How the story started is the goddess Hylia had a fight with the Demon King Demise. Hylia managed to imprison him, but the land was severely damaged. So she sent all of the people into the sky. Back to Skyloft, what happens is Zelda is abducted from Skyloft (the sky island the game takes place on). Link takes the Master Sword and finds a way to the surface. On the surface, Link finds and saves Zelda. However, the are confronted by Ghirahim, who wants to free Demise. They then escape and Link upgrades his sword to the Goddess Sword. After two attempts of escape by Demise (which Link prevents), Zelda seals herself into a crystal to strengthen the seal and turns's Link's sword into the Master Sword. Link takes the Triforce and uses it to defeat Demise. Ghirahim takes Zelda which leads Link to follow and defeat him. However, Zeldas body is then used to reincarnate Demise in his humanoid form. Link defeats Demise, who with his rage curses Zelda and Link's descendants to be haunted by his rage forever. Demise's essence also gets absorbed into the sword. Link then drives the it's pedestal completing the seal. Link and Zelda then establish the kingdom of Hyrule on the surface. This game was an amazing prequel to every Zelda game. There was one part I forgot to mention however. What also made the game bad was your helper, Fi. I'm not even going to describe how annoying Fi was. </p>

	<p> This game was very similar to Ocarina of Time. It had similar movement, Z-targeting, Epona (Link's horse), similar weapons (it had some new weapons however), and it takes place in the same area (centuries later). However, it had two new mechanics: Link could turn into a wolf and Midna. It wasn't really a special game by any means. The plot is essentially Hyrule gets shrouded in Twilight. Link then gets captured by Twilight beings and turned into a wolf. Midna, a little Twili (Twilight Creature) offers to free him and turn him back into a human if he agrees to listen to her unconditionally. Princess Zelda comes to him and tells him that Zant, the king of Twilight has taken over Hyrule Castle and cast the world into Twilight. He has to recover the spirits of light to recover Hyrule. Link then obtains the Master Sword and goes to the Gerudo Desert. They find the Mirror of Twilight (which allows you to go to the Twilight Realm) has been destroyed. It is then revealed that Ganon was banished to the Twilight realm after killing him failed. They then fix the mirror. The sages of Hyrule come out of nowhere and tell Link that Midna is the true ruler of the Twili. However, Zant made a pact with Ganon which allowed Zant to become ruler by weakening Midna. In return, Zant has to help take over Hyrule. They defeat Zant and Midna reveals that they need to defeat Ganon in order for the curse to be lifted. They return to Zelda to find out that Ganon has possessed her. Midna and Link work together to defeat Ganon and revive Zelda. Midna teleports them out of the castle but dies in the process as Ganon kills her. Link fights Ganon again and kills him. Midna is revived by Zelda and the Light Spirits and balance is restored to Hyrule and the Twilight Realm. It was a decent game overall. </p>

		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fi/4/46/Windwakerbox2.jpg" alt="Wind Waker" width="250px" height="250px">
	<p> This game was very visually appealing and had a huge map. You play as Link in a flooded Hyrule, creating a Great Sea full of islands. What happens in the game essentially is girls are randomly being taken throughout Hyrule. Link's sister gets abducted so he goes to save her. A mysterious man then orders to have him killed via being thrown in the ocean. As he's being thrown in, the king of hyrule saves him. He then explains that the mysterious man is Ganon and that he needs to Master Sword to slay him. Link then meets many people on the way who help him. He then meets Tetra who is the captain of a pirate ship. Link and Tetra decide to work together to free the girls. They then are intercepted by Ganon. The reason Ganon was abducting the girls was so he could find Zelda. As he's talking to Tetra and Link, he noticed Tetras Necklace. It has a triforce. This means that Tetra is the descendant of Zelda. Before Ganon captures them, they are saved by the king of Hyrule. Link then repairs the Master Sword and faces Ganon. Ganon is turned into stone and Hyrule is resumberged in water. Zelda then goes back into her original form as Tetra. The game ends with Link and Zelda sailing away. This game had a cartoony graphics style which made it fun to look at. This was a negative point to many people however as people were expecting a highly detailed game. At an earlier E3 conference, a trailer for a highly detailed Zelda game was displayed. However, we got Wind Waker. To most people, this was a dissapointment. However, this made the game more fun to look at. In some ways, it made the game look better too. The game had some great music. The main mechanics in it were the wind baton and Link's ship. Link could sail from island to island on his ship giving you a great area to explore. The wind baton was similar to the ocarina in Majoras Mask and Ocarina of Time. You could play specific songs on it and specific things would happen. I really like this game for how it looks. </p>

		<li id="number4"> Breath of the Wild</li>
		<img src="https://static.swappa.com/media/product/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-game/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-game-01.png" alt="Breath of the Wild" width="200px" height="250px">
	<p> Breath of the Wild was very different than all of the other Zelda games entirely. It introduced many new mechanics and doesn't really fit anywhere on the timeline. There isn't actually much to descirbe about the game. It was very beautiful (the Nintendo Switch's graphics are amazing) and had some really cool mechanics. For one, it was a true open world game. It had a huge map with tons of little secrets and interactable things. It had so many sidequests too. There was so much attention to detail everywhere. These ranged from small little artistic details to actual game mechanics hidden in plain sight. It had many items too. Instead of a classic Zelda backpack where you had the main quest items, your sword, your shield, some equipment, some weapons, a rupee bar, an arrow count, and a bomb count, this game had a survival game like backpack. The sections are: melee weapons, shields, bows, materials, and foods. Scattered about Hyrule in this game are a copious amount of items. An unlimited amount scattered about Hyrule. This was drastically different than every single game's item system. Breath of the Wild is in a certain sense unlimited. Theres almost no limit to what you can do. Theres so many mechanics in this game that if I listed all of them, it'd take up atleast 2-3 pages. The plot is simple. There were five champions of Hyrule (and Zelda). The champions were Link, Revali, Daruk, Mipha, and Naboris. The world gets corrupted by Ganon and Link is heavily wounded. Zelda then puts Link into a deep sleep and seals Ganon in Hyrule Castle. The plot was nothing though. What made this game great entirely was how much effort was put into the gameplay. It was amazing. </p>

		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/21/The_Legend_of_Zelda_A_Link_to_the_Past_SNES_Game_Cover.jpg/220px-The_Legend_of_Zelda_A_Link_to_the_Past_SNES_Game_Cover.jpg" alt="Link to the Past" width="250px" height="250px">
	<p> Link to the Past's was extremely innovative. It had better sounds and better graphics. It also had many new and improved mechanics. When Link attacks with his sword, instead of stabbing forward, he does a swing. This makes it much easier to fight. Also, Link can now walk diagnonally and run (with Pegasus Boots). Many items were introduced too, many would be added in future games. These included: the hookshot, master sword, pegasus boots, and spin attack (not an item, more of a technique). Other improvements were the fact that arrows were now seperate items (you used to use 1 rupee to fire an arrow) and a magic meter. Every single one of these mechanics/ items was used again in tons of Zelda games in the future. The plot wasn't terribly special, but still interesting. To sum it up, Link awakens to Zelda sending him a telepathic message asking him to save her. His uncle walks into the room, ready for battle and tells him to stay in bed. Link disobeys this and walks into the castle. When he enters, he finds his uncle, wounded. He gives Link his sword and shield. He then tells Link to save Zelda and dies. Link then rescues Zelda and they get to a sanctuary. The keeper at the sanctuary tells Link that Agahnim, an evil wizard has taken the throne wants to break the seal containing the Dark World. The Dark World was originally known as the Sacred Realm. However, after Ganon obtained the Triforce and he corrupted the sacred realm. In response to this, the seven sages cast a seal to contain all of this. Agahnim plans to break this seal and cast Hyrule into darkness. What Link has to do is obtain the Master Sword and kill Agahnim. After Link gets the Master Sword, he finds out that Zelda has been captured and taken to Hyrule Castle. Link goes to Hyrule Castle, defeats Agahnim, but gets sent to the Dark World. Link then saves the seven sages (who have been sent to the Dark World) and fights Agahnim again. After defeating him, Agahnim reveals that all along, he was actually Ganon. Link then has to fight Ganon. After Ganon has been slayed, Link uses the triforce to restore Hyrule and the Dark World to how they were originally. Overall, this game was amazing. </p>

		<li id="number2"> Ocarina of Time</li>
		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8e/The_Legend_of_Zelda_Ocarina_of_Time_box_art.png/220px-The_Legend_of_Zelda_Ocarina_of_Time_box_art.png" alt="Ocarina of Time" width="250px" height="250px">
	<p> Ocarina of time is regarded as one of the best games of all time. It is also regarded as the best Zelda game. It was the first 3d Zelda game and was without a doubt an amazing one. It had many reintroduced items and mechanics (except in 3d). However, it had a new and innovative mechanic. This was Z-Targeting. It allowed you to focus on a certain direction or entity. This allows you to accurately aim and move. Also, you get an ocarina. What you do on it is play songs. Those songs do various effects. For example, if you play the song of storms, it rains. It's hard to say what exactly was good about Ocarina of Time. It was just a good game, flawless is many ways. It had a great balance between plot and gameplay.  To describe the plot would be hard. Almost every side quest and almost every location in the game is part of the plot in a certain sense. What happens is Link, Kokiri boy (a race of kids who never grow) awakens from a nightmare of a girl on horseback being pursued by a man in black. Link also gets a fairy named Navi who tells him that the great Deku Tree has called him. The Deku Tree is cursed and tells Link that a wicked man from the desert has cursed him. He then tells him that he has to stop this man and talk to the princess. As he dies, he gives Link the Spiritual Stone of the Forest and Link gets out of the forest. He then infiltrates Hyrule Csatle and talks to Zelda. She tells him that she believes that Ganon, the king of the Gerudos wants to take the Triforce. She then tells him that he needs to obtain the 3 spiritual stones to open the temple of time. That way she can save the triforce. After Link obtains the other two stones, his dream comes true and he sees Zelda being chased by Ganon. Zelda throws Link the Ocarina of Time to open the Temple of Time and runs off. Link opens the Temple of Time and pulls the Master Sword. However, now Ganon has possesion of the triforce. Link then gets frozen for seven years. Link then awakens as an adult. It is now revealed that he is not a Kokiri. One of the sages then comes up to him and tells him he needs to awaken each sage. On the way, a mysterious figure named Sheik helps you along the way. After doing this, Zelda comes to him and reveals that she was Sheik all along. She then explains that the triforce was split and shared between Link, Zelda, and Ganon. Ganon then captures Zelda and Link rescues her. Then Link faces Ganon. However, there is no real ending at this point. The timeline actually splits. In one timeline, Link is slain by Ganon. In another, Link kills Ganon and is sent back in time. Ganon is then sealed in the corrupted sacred realm. However, the seal weakens and the world is flooded. The last timeline is Link slays Ganon and is sent back in time to warn Zelda. The timeline Ocarina of Time follows is the last one. After Link kills Ganon, he is sent back in time to warn Zelda. Ocarina of Time was great. While my explanation was bad, the plot, gameplay, and just everything was great about it. </p>

		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/60/The_Legend_of_Zelda_-_Majora%27s_Mask_Box_Art.jpg/220px-The_Legend_of_Zelda_-_Majora%27s_Mask_Box_Art.jpg" alt="Majora's Mask" width="250px" height="250px">
	<p> Despite what I said about Ocarina of Time, graphic, Majoras Mask is my favorite of all of the games. Gameplay wise, it's the same as Ocarina of Time (its a direct sequel on the N64). It Z-Targeting, same items, and a lot of the same enemies/sprites. However, what makes the game cool is all of the masks. In this game, there are about 25 masks. When you wear them, they do some sort of special effect. For example, the Deku mask turns you into Deku Link. You are able to shoot bubbles and burrow into giants flowers. Some masks are fairly mundane (an example is the All Night Mask which is only used for one side quest), but each one adds to the game in some way. There's a movement speed mask, a mask that attracts fairies and so much more. The major masks in this game however are the transformation masks. Theres 4 transformation masks: the Deku Mask, Goron Mask, Zora Mask, and Fierce Deity's Mask. I already mentioned what you can do as Deku Link. As a Goron, you can do super punches, roll around, and do a ground slam. As a Zora, you can swim, dive, and shoot boomerangs. All three of these are important for certain puzzles or reaching certain areas. The Fierce Deity's mask is obtained when you get all of the masks. It makes you extremely powerful BUT it can only be used on the final boss. There's also so many side quests. Any area you go to, theres a side quest. They're all fairly fun too. The main part of the game that people disliked is the 3 day cycle of the game. In the game, you have 3 days before the world is destroyed. 3 in game days in real life is only 54 minutes. You must be wondering: "then how do you do all of the sidequests, dungeons, etc?" What you can do is travel back in time with your ocarina. Like in Ocarina of Time, you use your Ocarina to play songs which do various effects. The plot is simple. Link is strolling through a forest when he gets knocked out by a skullkid (who steals his ocarina). Link chases the skullkid and falls down a hole into a parallel world called Termina. Termina will be destroyed in 3 days by a moon in the sky. Your goal is to regain your ocarina and save Termina. People usually will really dislike the time system and such, but overall, I'd say this is the best Zelda game. While the 3 day time limit was tough at times, it gave extra challenge and added so many time specific things to do (certain quests or events at a certain day/hour). It might've not been as good as Ocarina of Time, but it sure is my favorite.  </p>
