<h1 class=title>The Story of Jimothy</h1>
<h3>Stay in bed</h3>
<p>You decide to stay in bed and be extremely lazy. You blindly reach your phone and stare into space for 3 hours. You then have the sudden urge to sneeze so as a preparatory motion, you put your arm up. You move your arm way too fast and accidentally hit the lamp. The lamp then falls off of your desk causing shards of glass to fly everywhere. They all miss you but one stray shard hits the string holding up your curtain.The big pole that hold the curtains then goes unstable and falls down. This perfectly nails a spoon that contains some grapes. The spoon is half on the desk and half off of the desk causing the spoon to catapult grapes in all directions. The grape then hits a light switch flicking it down. Normally, this would turn off the light, but the electrician of the house was drunk when designing the house so somehow, the lightswitch turns on when you flick it up! This turns on your lamp which is still connected to the socket. Since the glass had shattered, the filament heats up and burns a bit of the carpet. Then, the carpet lights on fire. Your house in now on fire.</p>
