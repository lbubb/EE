<h3>Sock</h3>
<p> You grab the sock. You then take the pebbles out of the sock and start tossing them at the skeleton. There’s one problem however. The only method of throwing rocks you’ve ever learned was skipping stones. So you attempt to skip the pebbles at the skeleton with no success. Eventually, you run out of pebbles. Then, you see written on the sock “look into me”. You then look into the sock. You wait 5 seconds and nothing happens. Then, when you look out, you get blinded with a flash of light. You then realize that you had been sleeping on the couch the whole time and that you had some weird fever dream. You then want to sleep more to continue the, but you remember your friend dared you to watch the 3rd season of Breaking Bad in one weekend. So you keep on watching. It turns out you were sleeping the whole time. <span id="f">END</span></p>
