<h3>Get up</h3>
<p>You get up and yawn. You then walk out of your room and slide down the stairs. Some mysterious force then bumps you and you go careening in the air. Midair, you manage to grab some cereal. You then starts to eat it out of the box. BUT WAIT, CEREAL TASTES TERRIBLE WITHOUT MILK. So you change trajectory and open the fridge while still spinning mid air. You then find the milk after 5 minutes of searching and go get a bowl. You then put them all together at once. BUT WAIT, THERE’S NO SPOON! The problem is, there’s no more spoons in your house. One day, you sold all of your spoons for a single penny. The person who sold you it said that it was a rare mint condition 1900 penny. Turns out that it was just a dime with brown paint. You want to get a spoon, but instead you scoop the milk and cereal with your bare hands. After finishing your breakfast, you wonder what to do next…</p>
