<h3>Black Clothes</h3>
<p>You put on all black clothes. This causes all of the light in the room to be sucked in your general vicinity. You shrug this off and walk outside. Immediately, as you step outside, all of the Sun’s UV rays and all of the light around of you starts to get rapidly absorbed into the black fabric of your clothing. You then start heating up rapidly with a lightless aura slowly starting to surround you and expand. Eventually you gain critical mass and collapse creating a supermassive black hole. Great job Jim, you’ve destroyed the universe. <span id="f">END</span>
