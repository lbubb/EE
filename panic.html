<h3>PANIC</h3>
<p>You panic very hard. You put some water on the fire, but that just makes it worse as it’s an electrical fire. You then start throwing things at the fire to potentially stifle it. Surprisingly, this starts to work. All goes well until you throw your phone at it. The battery then combusts spewing molten fragments everywhere. You then decide nothing can be done and so push your bed to the side. This reveals a trapdoor leading to your secret cellar of cottage cheese. As the fire rages on, you slowly start to eat your cottage cheese. After about 15 minutes, you decide to peek out. Your house is completely scorched. To make things worse, you’re in the famous wooden house district of your city. Where everything is at least 90% wood. Great, you’ve set the entire neighborhood on fire. <span id="f">END</span></p>
