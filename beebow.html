<h1 class=title>The Story of Jimothy</h1>
<h3>Bee Bow</h3>
<p> You choose the bee bow. You dry fire it rapidly until you realize that you’re firing it wrong. You then realize you were holding it upside down. You flip it and unleash hell on this skeleton. The bees repeatedly sting the skeleton and bite it. The skeleton is visibly disturbed. The bees then use their finishing move. They completely surround the skeleton and shake their little bodies. The friction heats the skeleton to 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit. You have destroyed the skeleton! You then inspect the pile of ashes the skeleton has left behind. You find a little box. In the box is a photo of you as a baby. Then, there’s a photo of you in grade school. Then there’s a photo of you in highschool. There’s a photo of you in college. Then there’s a picture of you as an adult and beyond! Then it hits you: no wonder the skeleton looked familiar, it was YOU! You had somehow destroyed the past, present, and future. You inspect the sword. It was actually not a sword. It was a scroll. You decide to open it up. It says: “Happy Birthday”. You then remember, IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY. You then feel your hands slowly start to fizzle away into dust (just like in Infinity War). You had destroyed the past, present, and future. You slowly sit there thinking about all of the great memories your life had. Also, what a crazy dream it was. Wait, a dream? You shoot out of bed. You’re not Jimothy, you’re never ate breakfast, you never set your house on fire, infact, none of that happened. You’re a kid named Timothy who lives in Pennsylvania! <span id="f">END</span></p>
